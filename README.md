# A Simple Raytracer

A simple program to render scenes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that I'm working on in my spare time. This is a "scratchpad" type project so I'm not expecting it to be pretty.

Tentative roadmap:
* [ ] write a png image with ``libpng``;
* [ ] render spheres with no colours;
* [ ] depth map;
* [ ] normal map;
* [ ] colours;
* [ ] ...materials?
